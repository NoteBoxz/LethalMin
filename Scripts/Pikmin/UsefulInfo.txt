We'll have to manually cache the entrance points our selves. Because they only get assigned when a player uses an exit
For the outside entrance, the entrance point varible is set to it's own telepoint. for the exit point varible it is set to the telepoint of the entrance inside.
Same for the inside entrance, the entrance point is set to it's own point, and the exit point is set to the outside telepoint.

So: 
EntracePoint = Exit's own telepoint
ExitPoint = Exit's destination telepoint, should be it's outside/inside equivilant
