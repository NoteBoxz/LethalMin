-- To Do --

- Add Mod Definition to allow dependencies

-- bugs --

- ReXuvination causes the pikmin collision detect to break
- LethalMin.PikminItem.GetNearestGrabPosition throws a null refernce exception (Due to null settings most likely)
- end of day stats cover more company extra slots
- grabbing an onion item at the same time it leaves causes the infamous LC interaction bug


-- things to refactor --

- Implument proper task system instead of just carrying and attacking

- Add system for a single snap point instead of just multiple spesfic ones for the car, idle, ect.

- Add Pikmin 3 SFX

- Refactor Winged Flying to take shortcuts


-- would be cool --

- Make Pikmin scatter after leader gets masked

- Add Funi Ragdolls

- Make onion revive maskeds

- Have Undefined Pikmin replace every other type on some days as like a hard mode

-- unproitized bugs --

Fix Desynced Dead Pikmin (Caused by gaurd clause bools being desynced)

Fix Onion HUD slot Going Into the negetives (No idea)

Fix buggy Winged Pesudo Flying (Flying into cealings, and sometimes under the ship)

Fix Pikmin flip flopping between exits (Unable to reporduce consistantly, happens mostly on march)

Fix RadMech not playing moving animation on other clients after burning pikmin (Unable to reporduce consistantly)

Fix Purples and White being multiplied when moved from container to onion (hack fix)

Fix bug with item being picked up by pikmin not being properly synced (might have fixed)

Fix glowmin getting stuck to items on clinet side when carrying inside before 5 (Unable to reporduce)

Fix bug that occours when a pikmin gets trapped in a slime at the exact same time it grabs an item (Unable to reporduce consistantly)

Fix already collected onion spawning that when collected, the data for all other onions will be erased (Unable to reporduce, Hack Fix)

Fix multiplayer stats not show properly at end of round with 3 or more players
(Already fixed or unable to replicate)

Add teleport trigger to ship for pikmin moons that don't have links onto the ship
(Not entirely sure how to implument this)

Fix weird body desync bug that speseficly occurs when player 1 and player 3 dies, then player 2 attempts to throw pikmin that were taken from the onion onto player 1's body-
-which then causes 2 instances of player 1's body to be picked up with both bodies being visble to players 1 and 3 but onlt 1 body being visible player 2.
(UNABLE TO REPLICATE!!!!)

Fix lag when setting pikmin to onions at the end of the day (Potinally not a bug)

Fix Pikmin not being whistleable after bringing back courps to onion (Potinally not a bug)

Fix non owner-side pikmin 'stuttering' for pikmin that are moving slowly
(To do this I think I need to sync each pikmin's agent speed and I think that too much effort-for such a minor bug)
