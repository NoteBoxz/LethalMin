Refactor Winged Flying to take shortcuts

-unproitized bugs-

Fix Desynced Dead Pikmin (Caused by gaurd clause bools being desynced)

Fix Onion HUD slot Going Into the negetives (No idea)

Fix buggy Winged Pesudo Flying (Flying into cealings, and sometimes under the ship)

Fix weird body desync bug that speseficly occurs when player 1 and player 3 dies, then player 2 attempts to throw pikmin that were taken from the onion onto player 1's body-
-which then causes 2 instances of player 1's body to be picked up with both bodies being visble to players 1 and 3 but onlt 1 body being visible player 2.
